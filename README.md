This app will allow the user to search their city for craft breweries. Information will be pulled from the [Open Brewery Database](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/).

Users will be able to enter a city and state to recieve a list of craft breweries located there. Listed breweries can be clicked on to recieve more detailed data including a link to the brewerie's website.

Stretch goals: Add map locations for found breweries and a search option that uses distance from your location instead of a city designation. May use [The Beer Mapping Project](https://beermapping.com/) and/or [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/apis-by-platform) to achieve this.
